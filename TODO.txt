- MORE MAP STUFF:
	in order to have the forest generated as we want, we need to navigate
	by metaLocation. If the map is already saved, use the saved one. If the
	map metaLocation is not already saved, generate a new one and save it.


-build procedurally generated forest
-add dialogue and "level" progression
-game menus
-add sound effects and music

-update menu with forest actions (dig, list seeds, )
-"death" of player in forest

-do not save continuously, wait until done calling "save"
-tutorial
-credits
-load image assets
