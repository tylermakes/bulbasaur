DONE:
!make a migration function for maps (or simpler save?)
!remove navigation from side menu
!add navigation tiles to forest map
!add navigation tiles to garden map
!add exit in home to garden
!slow down animation for player movement
!save player items, construct inventory and player object from that
!save\load the current state of your inventory
!save\load the current state of the garden
!-save/load game
!-start new game
!exit button
!save\load your current location (home, forest, garden)
!add bush to hide in
!more procedurally generated levels

!- MORE MAP STUFF:
	in order to have the forest generated as we want, we need to navigate
	by metaLocation. If the map is already saved, use the saved one. If the
	map metaLocation is not already saved, generate a new one and save it.
